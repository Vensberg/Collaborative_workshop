# Collaborative_workshop
Illustrates how GitHub addresses collaboration pain points:
* Do we have all the data?
  * What data were collected?
* Where are the data?
  * Collaborators at University X use Box, but we use Google Drive. How do we keep track of everything?
* Have you done the preliminary analysis?
* Who did the preliminary analysis?
* Did you include data Y in your analysis?
* Who is supposed to collect data Z?
* When is collection of Z supposed to happen?
